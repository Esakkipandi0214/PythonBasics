<!-- Variable Names -->

1. A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
2. A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
3. A variable name cannot start with a number
4. A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
5. Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
6. A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

<!-- Allowed variables naming like -->

1. myvar = "John"
2. my_var = "John"
3. _my_var = "John"
4. myVar = "John"
5. MYVAR = "John"
6. myvar2 = "John"


<!-- Multi Words Variable Names -->

<!-- Camel Case -->
// Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

# myVariableName = "John"


<!-- Pascal Case -->
// Each word starts with a capital letter:

# MyVariableName = "John"


<!-- Snake Case -->
// Each word is separated by an underscore character:

# my_variable_name = "John"
